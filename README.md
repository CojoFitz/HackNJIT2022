# HackNJIT2022
CAMPR - Camping themed friends app centered around creating friend groups. 

**Project information**
The project itself is simply a prototype and is not fully functional for standalone use, this is due to the nature of this project being created within the environment of a hackathon. Though functionality does work for the chatroom system, login system, and other systems. A more broad implementation of these systems is possible, but was not completed due to the scope and time limitations of the hackathon. This project primarily utilizes php but also features css, javascript, and html. SQL was also utilized for the implementation of backend databases for the chatroom feature. 





**Contributor Information**
This project was created by Jerry Zheng, Nick Merlino, Conor J. Fitzpatrick, and George Tipton. While the github indicates Jerry and Nick as the primary contributors, they were not the only contributors as George and Conor also played a major role in the development of the front end (as well as the backend to a degree). Nick and Jerry are the main contributors, as the way we approached the project made it so that they were the only ones who needed to directly interact with the github.



**Project Purpose**
CAMPR is a friend making app that was created for the 2022 NJIT Hackathon, which was themed around camping hacks. The idea behind campr is that it is a group-based matching system, as opposed to the singular based matching system that many friend making apps follow.
